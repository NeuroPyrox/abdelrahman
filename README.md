I used this project as a test to see how good I would be a freelance programming.
I stopped working on it on Feb. 13 because Abdelrahman stopped responding to my texts, I assume because I wasn't writing the code fast enough or he found another developer.
Anyways, the bulk of my work is in the finishedUserStories branch with a bunch of TODOs scattered throughout.
