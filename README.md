I used this project as a test to see how good I would be a freelance programming.
I stopped working on it on Feb. 13 because Abdelrahman stopped responding to my texts. Our mutual friend told me he's been way too busy this semester and won't have time to sell food.
Anyways, the bulk of my work is in the finishedUserStories branch with a bunch of TODOs scattered throughout.
